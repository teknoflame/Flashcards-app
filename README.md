# Flashcards-app

A small, static flashcards web app (single-page) for creating, viewing, and studying flashcards.

This repository currently contains a minimal front-end (an `index.html`) intended as a lightweight starting point for a flashcards application. The app is designed to be easy to run locally and extend with JavaScript, styling, and persistent storage later.

## Key points

- Tech: plain HTML (single-file). Can be enhanced with JavaScript, CSS, or a front-end framework.
- Purpose: provide a simple, local flashcards experience for studying and review.

## What you can do

- Open `index.html` in your browser to run the app locally.
- Extend the project by adding JS for card creation, editing, persistence (localStorage or a backend), and testing.

## How to run

Since this project is a static HTML file, there are two quick ways to run it locally:

1. Open directly in your browser

   - Double-click `index.html` or open it from your browser's File > Open menu.

2. Serve from a simple HTTP server (recommended for features that require fetch/XHR)

   - Using Python 3:

     ```bash
     python -m http.server 8000
     # then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
     ```

   - Using Node (http-server):

     ```bash
     npx http-server -p 8000
     # then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
     ```

## Project structure

- `index.html` — the single-page entry point. Edit or split into separate `css`/`js` files as needed.

## Development ideas / Next steps

- Add `app.js` and `styles.css` and move inline code out of `index.html`.
- Implement CRUD for flashcards with `localStorage` for persistence.
- Add import/export (JSON) for decks.
- Add unit tests and a lightweight test runner or CI configuration.

## Assumptions

- This README assumes the repository currently contains only a static `index.html` (based on the workspace snapshot). If the project includes more files or a build system, update this README with the exact commands and dependencies.

## Contributing

- Fork the repo, create a feature branch, and open a pull request describing your changes.

## License

Add a license file (for example `LICENSE`) if you plan to share this publicly. No license is included by default.

If you want, I can extend this README with a feature list based on the actual app behavior (I can read `index.html` and summarize its features), or scaffold a small JS/CSS structure and example tests — tell me which you'd prefer.
